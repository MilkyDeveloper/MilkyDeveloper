# ＭｉｌｋｙＤｅｖｅｌｏｐｅｒ

A list of languages i'm fluent in:

* C# (in a desktop stack)
* Javascript
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Shell Scripting

Some skills/specalties I'm currently pursuing:

* Financial Data Science
* Linux Kernel development (specifically for Chromebooks)
* Web Development/Design
  * I prefer static sites without a build step
* Windows DLL Injection
* Complex Windows apps to replace system components

I'd like to learn C, C++, or Rust, but at the moment I don't need the speed of them. In the future, I'll probably use Go.

### Quick note about JS Frameworks
> *Warning*: Controversial Topic

Many say that you need to use React, Vue, or Angular to build a proper Dynamic Web App. I simply don't get it: why do I need a **500mb+** of NPM modules with tiny pieces of code in them. I would rather just code in normal JS, or use Svelte, which has a very appealing and simple syntax.
